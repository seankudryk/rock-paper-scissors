A super simple browser version of Rock, Paper, Scissors. There is no user interface designed for this, so playing the game will require you to open browser tools and track the game state through outputs in the console.

By default, the total rounds are set to 10, but you can change this by changing the argument passed to the playGame(rounds) function - the final line of the script file. ie. playGame(8) to have the game last 8 rounds, playGame(2) to have the game last 2 rounds, etc.
